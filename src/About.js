        <p>
          Here, at <b>The Spice Factory</b>, in the center of London, we don‚Äôt
          accept compromises. Not about our food. All our ingredients are
          sourced from local producers to ensure quality and freshness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That's why our menu is seasonal. Today, we may serve you creamy
          mushroom soup, and tomorrow we may have a classic ratatouille on the
          menu. But the taste is always the same: finger-licking good!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Forget about the daily stress and come relax with us. After tasting
          any of our menu items, you will never want to leave!
        </p>
